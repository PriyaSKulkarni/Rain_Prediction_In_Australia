Rain Prediction in Australia


🌟 Excited to announce that I've completed the IBM Certified Machine Learning course with honors! 🎓 Throughout this comprehensive program, I've gained hands-on experience in a wide array of machine learning algorithms and techniques.

🔍 For my honors project, I had the opportunity to dive into a fascinating rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. 🌧️ Applying Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM algorithms, I built predictive models to forecast rainfall patterns. The project also involved meticulous evaluation using metrics such as accuracy score, Jaccard index, F1-score, and log loss.

💼 This experience has not only deepened my understanding of machine learning concepts but has also equipped me with practical skills in data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation.

🚀 I'm excited to leverage these skills in my future endeavors and contribute to impactful projects in the field of data science and machine learning!
